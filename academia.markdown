## MOA4PLA (Software)

Main developer of OPLA-Tool.

The Multi-Objective Optimization Approach for PLA design (MOA4PLA) [Colanzi et al., 2014], as the name says, is an approach to optimize Product Line Architectures (PLAs) design using multi-objective algorithms. MOA4PLA receives a PLA modeled in a UML class diagram containing all commonalities and variabilities, and optimize it while being guided by an evaluation model composed by software metrics. At the end of the optimization process, a set of solutions with the best trade-off between objectives is generated and the architect may select which architecture will be used.
