About two and a half years ago I was going to my first fully remote international job as Software Engineer. In these more than
2 years working mainly with Ruby (and some lasts months with Python), I learn a lot about how hospitality business works and how to work with a fully distributed. I have the opportunity to meet great people, working from different locations as well (Brazil, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, etc).

All this time work fully remotely (with few in-person meetups) makes me believe even more in remote work. IT WORKS!
I still believe in remote work, and I plan to keep working in that way, also I enjoy working with Ruby programming language, so
I am very happy to make the announcement (to nobody I think :d) that I join next week with [Iubenda team](https://www.iubenda.com/)!

That's it, I hope brings here more things about my job there soon, if possible.


Best,
(keep safe at HOME in this troubled times)
